'''
The following code is an example of reading the pipe-delimited Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) 
   data into an Pandas dataframe. Specifically, this code loads in both the primary data file 
   and the calendar-year replicate weights file (as opposed to the longitudinal replicate weights). These files are 
   separate downloads on the SIPP website.
SIPP data are in person-month format, meaning each record represents one month for a specific person.
   Unique persons are identified using SSUID+PNUM. Unique households are identified using SSUID+ERESIDENCEID. For 
   additional guidance on using SIPP data, please see the SIPP Users' Guide at <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp/guidance/users-guide.html>
This code was written in Python 3, and requires version 0.24 or higher of the Pandas module. 
Note the use of 'usecols' in the first pd.read_csv statement. Most machines do not have enough memory to read
   the entire SIPP file into memory. Use 'usecols' to read in only the columns you are interested in. If you
   still encounter an out-of-memory error, either select less columns, or consider using the Dask module.
Run this code in the same directory as the extracted data.
Please contact the SIPP Coordination and Outreach Staff at census.sipp@census.gov if you have any questions.
